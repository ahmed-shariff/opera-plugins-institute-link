[opera plugin](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/) to rename publication url to institute url (currently hard coded to use OpenAthens UBC redirect).

Technically this should work in chrome as well. Haven't tested it though. 

### Installation
To install, download the extension (`.crx` file) from the [releases](https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/opera-plugins-institute-link/releases). 

Alternatively, you can install from the source. To install from source (copied from [opera's tutorial for making an extension](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/#step-4-testing-your-extension)):

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to the browser address bar and type opera:extensions (or use the Cmd/Ctrl Shift E shortcut)
2. Check the “Developer Mode” button to enable it.
3. Click on the “Load Unpacked Extension…” button.
4. Select your extension’s directory

### Usage

Currently there is a button that would appear on the extensions (generally next to the browsers url text field, somwhere around the top-right corner of the browser). While on the webpage of a publication, you can do the redirect by pressing that button. You can also use the shortcut, currently bound to `Ctrl+Shift+U`. You should be able to modify this in the browser settings.
