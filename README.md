[opera plugin](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/) to rename publication url to institute url (currently hard coded to use OpenAthens UBC redirect).

Technically this should work in chrome as well. Haven't tested it though. 

To install, download the extension (~.crx~ file) from the [releases](https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/opera-plugins-institute-link/releases). 

Alternatively, you can install from the source. To install from source (copied from [opera's tutorial for making an extension](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/#step-4-testing-your-extension)):

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to the browser address bar and type opera:extensions (or use the Cmd/Ctrl Shift E shortcut)
2. Check the “Developer Mode” button to enable it.
3. Click on the “Load Unpacked Extension…” button.
4. Select your extension’s directory
